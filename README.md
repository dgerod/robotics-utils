Algorithms for robots developed in [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/).

List of algorithms :
* delta-2 kinematics using Scilab
* delta-3 kinematics using Scilab
* scara kinematics using Scilab

This code was automatically exported from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/robotics-utils). Now __this repository is deprecated__ because the algorithms are integrated in [RTSX](https://github.com/dgerod/rtsx).
